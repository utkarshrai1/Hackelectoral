# Hackelectoral
Our team Hackelectoral is aiming to solve the problems of Non-Resident Voters who cannot come to their area to vote for their candidate, we are planning to make an online portal that is secure and also maintains the secrecy of the vote.
The identity of voters will be nowhere saved with the vote, yet we will make a method to verify each vote to the people.
Our online portal will be trustworthy for the voters, and our portal will have everything to satisfy the voters about the electoral authenticity.
We are also planning to make a system such that an e-voter card is allotted to each citizen as soon as she turns 18, we may need to access the Aadhar database or similar database, for this purpose. A simple palmtop computer at every polling booth can make a revolutionary change in the electoral process of India. We will design this such that it will work securely even without internet access in remote areas.
We will also make a portal for instant registration of the voters if somebody's name is not in the voter list.
We will also make a secure system to count the votes in a fast and efficient way without any error.

Azure Blockchain will be used by us to make the process secure, and the voting system will be highly secured. The online voting system that we are planning is better than the present EVM voting system, and our system can also be applied to these EVMs, after slight modification.
